# Twitter Text Analysis
A repository for our first text analysis project.

Main goal: 
  + scrape data from twitter with tags (tweet, location, date produced, account id?) from a single or multiple hashtags
  + clean the data using tools (eg. pandas)
      - remove stop words in the tweets
  + detect most used words
  + how each tweets relate by context
  + trends (eg. correlate tweets based on when the account who tweeted was produced?)
